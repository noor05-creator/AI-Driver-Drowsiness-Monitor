## 📌 Overview

Driver Drowsiness Monitor is a real-time AI-powered safety system that detects driver fatigue through webcam feed analysis. It combines geometric eye tracking (Eye Aspect Ratio) with a trained Convolutional Neural Network to accurately identify drowsiness and trigger an audio alert before an accident can occur.

This project was developed as a final exam submission for Semester 5, covering Python data science libraries, OpenCV, deep learning, data visualization, an AI-based game, and version control with Git.

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time face and eye detection using dlib's 68-point facial landmark model
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation for geometric drowsiness detection
- CNN trained on the MRL Eye Dataset for learned eye state classification
- Dual-confirmation alert system (EAR + CNN must both agree)
- Audio alarm that triggers on drowsy confirmation and stops on recovery
- Professional HUD overlay showing live EAR, CNN confidence, and session timer
- Session event logging to CSV using Pandas
- Analytics dashboard with 3 Matplotlib charts generated from session data
- Pygame reaction-time mini game with scoring and performance analysis
- Full Git workflow with branching, PRs, and documented contributions

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or 3.10
- A working webcam
- Git

### Step 1 — Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drowsiness-monitor.git
cd drowsiness-monitor
```

### Step 2 — Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 — Download dlib landmark predictor
Download `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` from:
[https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models/raw/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2]

Extract and place the `.dat` file in the root project folder.

### Step 5 — Download the dataset
Download the MRL Eye Dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kutaykutlu/drowsiness-detection

Place images in:
- `/data/open/` — eyes open images
- `/data/closed/` — eyes closed images

## 🚀 How to Run

### Train the model (run once)
```bash
python model_train.py
```
This saves the trained model to `/model/drowsiness_cnn.h5` and training curves to `/assets/training_curves.png`.

### Run the live drowsiness detector
```bash
python main.py
```
Press `Q` to quit. Session events are logged to `/logs/session_log.csv`.

### Generate analytics dashboard
```bash
python analytics.py
```
Reads session log and saves a 3-chart dashboard to `/assets/session_report.png`.

### Run the reaction time game
```bash
python game.py
```
10 trials. Press `SPACE` when the red circle appears. Results saved to `/logs/game_results.csv`.
